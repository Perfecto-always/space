## About
A simple game project Space Invaders inspired by old console game. The idea for it stems from a this article about challenging projects for programmer. Courtesy: [Austin Z. Henley]("https://austinhenley.com/blog/challengingprojects.html")

This projects doesn't use any libraries (except for vite and typescript) only the standard Canvas API provided by the browser. 

### Things learnt from this project
- Game event loop
- AABB collision detection
- Drawing on screen
- Handling various game state (though I think I did a bad job)

### What I could've improved/added
- Sound
- Animations
- Better UI
- Difficulty

This sums up the project for me. I may visit it in future and add some more features stated above or just improve code, who knows `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`
